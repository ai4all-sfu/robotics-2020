###Robotics

The roboticâ€™s project consists of 4 phases:
1. Working with Tethys(robot) simulation.
	- Tethys is a visual programming tool, created to teach students computer science, robotics, and coding. In this simulation, you can work with both pepper and Nao. 
	As we are doing this program online and we do not have access to the robots (pepper), we need to go beyond Tethys and start coding.
2. Face Detection and Face Recognition
	- We will use Haar features to detect face: Haar cascade classifier is based on the Viola-Jones detection algorithm which is trained in given some input faces and non-faces and training a classifier that identifies a face.
	- We will use the LBP method to recognize faces: Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is computationally simple and relatively fast. LBP will take the facial feature extraction by dividing it into several small areas.
3. Sentiment Analysis using Textblob
	- Sentiment analysis is a method in NLP used to classify the emotion of human language. At the most common and basic level, the goal is to classify a text as positive, negative, or neutral.
We will use Textblob which is a Python library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks 
4.  Distance Estimation (Bonus)
	- And finally, as students do not have access to robots to see what sensors they use, we try to teach students about distance estimation based on an RGB image. We will use Neural Networks to find out if someone is keeping the social distance.

Students are required to fill in some missing parts of codes in each phase and then there will be a project combining 3 phases.
